Keypads are easy to interface to a microcontroller, but they usually require a lot of pins. This board will work with a variety of keypads and it only requires two pins (for the I2C bus). It will work with keypads up to 16 buttons and up to 8 pins on the keypad. Keypads are often arranged in a matrix (e.g. 4x4, 4x3, 3x3, 6x2, 7x1 etc.) and this board will work with these configurations. This project consists of small board that mounts to the back of the keypad, and provides an easy to use I²C interface with Grove type connectors. This board will work with either a 3.3 or a 5 volt I2C bus.

A demo program and software library are available for Arduino and Particle microcontroller boards. This library has many functions to make using these keypads easy to control.

Bare PC boards are available from OSH Park.
